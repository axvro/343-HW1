Some of the commonly used commands in git will be things like init. Init provides the user with an empty repository or reinitializes an old one. We will also use things like add, mv, restore, and rm which allow the user to work and edit the current changes. Other commands such as branch, commit, merge, switch to grow and edit the previous history of your peers. Lastly, commands like diff, log, show, status will be used to examine the history and state of the repository.
